    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this exercise is to obtain familiarity with NESTML by completing a partial model of the Izhikevich neuron [1]_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisites\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to have a working NEST Simulator and NESTML installation, see [Installing NESTML](https://nestml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to be able to run NESTML to generate and build model code. The recommended way is via the Python API. See [Running NESTML](https://nestml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume here that NEST Simulator is installed to `/home/beeblebrox/nest-simulator-build` and that we will generate code in `/tmp/nestml-component`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When starting the Python interpreter, these paths can be passed as environment variables, for example as follows (note the Python 3.6 version number, adapt as needed):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/beeblebrox/nest-simulator-build/lib/python3.6/site-packages LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/nestml-component ipython3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that on MacOS, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is called `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`.\n",

    "The Izhikevich model\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple model for spiking neurons that nevertheless can exhibit a wide variety of dynamical behaviour, depending on its parameter values [1]_. It is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{dv}{dt} &= 0.04 v^2 + 5 v + 140 - u + I\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{du}{dt} &= a (b v - u)\n",

    "   &\\text{if}\\;\\; v \\geq V_{th}:\\\\\n",
    "   &\\;\\;\\;\\; v \\text{ is set to } c\\\\\n",
    "   &\\;\\;\\;\\; u \\text{ is incremented by } d\\\\\n",
    "   & \\, \\\\\n",
    "   &v \\text{ jumps on each spike arrival by the weight of the spike}\n",

    "In the file :ref:`izhikevich_task.nestml <izhikevich_task.nestml>`, only a subset of the parameters, state equations and update block is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the .nestml file in a text editor and finish the partially-completed model.\n",
